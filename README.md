# Flower Species Classification Using ANNs

# Description:

This project utilizes PyTorch to implement transfer learning techniques for flower species classification. Leveraging a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the model is fine-tuned to categorize various flower species. Through transfer learning, this project showcases how to harness existing neural network knowledge for accurate classification tasks without starting from scratch.

# Key Features:

* Transfer Learning Approach: Utilizes a pre-trained ANN to expedite and enhance the training process for flower species classification.
* PyTorch Implementation: Demonstrates the use of PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, for model development and training.
* Dataset Utilization: Leverages flower species datasets for training and validation, enabling the network to learn and predict accurately.
* Fine-Tuning Demonstration: Illustrates the fine-tuning process to adapt the pre-trained network to recognize specific flower species.
* Classification Performance: Evaluates and demonstrates the model's classification accuracy and efficiency in recognizing flower species.
